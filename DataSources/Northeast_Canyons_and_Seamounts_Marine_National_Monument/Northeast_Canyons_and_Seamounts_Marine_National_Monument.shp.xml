On September 15, 2016, President Obama designated the first marine national monument in the Atlantic Ocean, the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, using his authority under the Antiquities Act of 1906.

The monument includes two distinct areas.  The Canyon Unit covers Oceanographer, Gilbert, and Lydonia Canyons. The Seamount Unit covers Bear, Physalia, Retriever, and Mytilus Seamounts. These are located about 130 miles east-southeast of Cape Cod, and cover a total area of more than 4,900 square miles, about the size of Connecticut, or slightly larger than Yellowstone National Park. 

From the Presidential Proclamation:
"The Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior (Secretaries) shall share management responsibility for the monument. The Secretary of Commerce, through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall have responsibility for management of activities and species within the monument under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Endangered Species Act (for species regulated by NOAA), the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and any other applicable Department of Commerce legal authorities. The Secretary of the Interior, through the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall have responsibility for management of activities and species within the monument under its applicable legal authorities, including the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act, the Refuge Recreation Act, and the Endangered Species Act (for species regulated by FWS), and Public Law 98-532 and Executive Order 6166 of June 10, 1933."</purpose></descript><secinfo><secsys>FIPS Pub 199</secsys><secclass>public</secclass><sechandl>Standard Technical Controls</sechandl></secinfo><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntperp><cntorg>NOAA Fisheries Service Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office, GIS Committee</cntorg><cntper>Dean-Lorenz Szumylo</cntper></cntperp><cntpos>GIS Specialist</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>55 Great Republic Drive</address><city>Gloucester</city><state>MA</state><postal>01930</postal></cntaddr><cntvoice>978-282-8479</cntvoice><cntfax>978-281-9333</cntfax><cntemail>dean.szumylo@noaa.gov</cntemail><cntinst>http://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/</cntinst></cntinfo></ptcontac></idinfo><dataqual><logic>Check Geometry test has been performed in ArcGIS.</logic><complete>Features represented are valid.

To standardize Regulated Area features sharing these boundaries, published shapefiles of the shared administrative boundaries were obtained from the authoritative agencies.  A shoreline was selected that was suitable for general mapping purposes, freely and publicly available, of medium-resolution, and covering the extent of the U.S..  When necessary, the boundaries were transformed to NAD83. A series of template polygon shapefiles were then generated, using these authoritative boundaries as the outward extents of the polygon.  All templates were generated in NAD83 geographic coordinate system.  The templates created are: 1) Coast-to-EEZ: bounded by the coastline, the U.S.-Canada Maritime Boundary, the U.S. EEZ, and 81°W longitude off the southern extent of Florida (an arbitrary cut-off for the Atlantic); 2) Coast-to-SLA: bounded by the coastline, the U.S.-Canada Maritime Boundary, the Submerged Lands Act boundary, and 81°W longitude off the southern extent of Florida; 3) SLA-to-EEZ: bounded by the Submerged Lands Act boundary, the U.S.-Canada Maritime Boundary, the U.S. EEZ, and 81°W longitude off the southern extent of Florida.  These templates were subsequently copied and edited, as needed by the Regulated Area spatial definitions.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2016</procdate><procdesc>[Get Definition Text] The spatial definition for the Monument was copied from the Press Release.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2016</procdate><procdesc>[Features From Templates] After determining that the bounding coordinates are connected following rhumb lines, the boundaries were drawn in an empty polyline shapefile (NAD83 geographic coordinate system) using the "Loxodrome" line type in the "Construct Geodetic" tool in ArcGIS 10. To generate the Monument boundary in ArcGIS, a copy of the Coast-to-EEZ template polygon was split by tracing this polyline boundary file. When the spatial definition specified that points were connected following the EEZ, the coinciding outward extent of the template polygon was used.  After all points were appropriately connected, any portions of the template outside the defined Monument areas were discarded.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2016</procdate><procdesc>[Add Attributes] An attribute schema was applied to the shapefile, and the fields were defined.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2016</procdate><procdesc>[Area Calculation] The shapefile was projected into a customized "USA_Contiguous_Albers_Equal_Area_Conic_USGS_version" projected coordinate system.  The coordinate system was modified to focus on the offshore region of the Monument.  Coordinate System modifications include adjusting projection parameters as follows:  False_Easting: 0.0; False_Northing: 0.0; Central_Meridian: -67.0775; Standard_Parallel_1: 38.865; Standard_Parallel_2: 40.6; Latitude_Of_Origin: 39.7325.  In the Equal Area shapefile, each feature's area was calculated in square miles and square kilometers.  These values were copied back to the un-projected NAD83 version of the shapefile.  Conversions to square nautical miles were calculated outside of GIS.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2016</procdate><procdesc>[Policy Review] The Monument spatial definition, shapefile geometry and attribute values were reviewed with policy staff to verify that the shapefile accurately depicted and described the intended boundaries.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2016</procdate><procdesc>[Check Geometry] The ESRI ArcGIS Check Geometry tool was run on the shapefile to identify any geometry problems.  If problems were encountered, they were reviewed and corrected.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2016</procdate><procdesc>[Metadata] A GARFO Regulated Area shapefile metadata template was developed using the EPA Metadata Editor v3.2.  This template was applied and customized to reflect the specific characteristics of the given shapefile.  The metadata was validated for FGDC CSDGM compliance.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2016</procdate><procdesc>[Final Review] The shapefile was reviewed by members of the GARFO GIS Committee, policy experts from the GARFO Division responsible for the Regulated Area, and General Counsel, according to the GARFO GIS Data Distribution Policy. The shapefile was then shared with colleagues at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for review by their agency.  Comments and feedback were incorporated into the data as necessary.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>20161202</procdate><procdesc>[Publication] The shapefile, with accompanying metadata, was uploaded for public download on the NOAA NMFS GARFO GIS website.</procdesc></procstep><srcinfo><typesrc>digital download (ESRI shapefile)</typesrc><srccitea>US EEZ</srccitea><srccontr>This source  marine boundary was used to generate template shapefiles, which were copied and used when Regulatory Area boundaries followed portions of the US Exclusive Economic Zone.</srccontr><srctime><srccurr>publication date</srccurr><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>20110501</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo></srctime><srccite><citeinfo><origin>Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service (NOS), Office of Coast Survey (OCS)</origin><title>USMaritimeLimitsNBoundaries</title><edition>1</edition><geoform>vector digital data</geoform><pubdate>20110501</pubdate><pubinfo><publish>NOAA's Ocean Service, Office of Coast Survey (OCS)</publish><pubplace>Silver Spring, MD</pubplace></pubinfo><onlink>http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/csdl/mbound.htm</onlink></citeinfo></srccite></srcinfo><srcinfo><typesrc>online</typesrc><srccitea>Press Release</srccitea><srccontr>This document identifies the bounding coordinates of the monument.</srccontr><srctime><srccurr>publication date</srccurr><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>20160915</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo></srctime><srccite><citeinfo><origin>U.S. Department of the Interior</origin><title>Secretaries Pritzker, Jewell Applaud President’s Designation of Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument</title><geoform>map</geoform><othercit>Citation is a joint Press Release issued by U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker and U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell, citing President Obama's designation of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument.
