## Data Sources
[**Exclusive Economic Zone**](https://doi.org/10.14284/312)
World EEZs were downloaded as a single file from the Flanders Marine Institute and trimmed to include only the EEZ of the United States that is encompassed by the area administered by the Greater Atlantic regional Fisheries Office (GARFO), as defined [here](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/map/greater-atlantic-region-statistical-areas). 

[**Coastal Zones**](http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2013/1284/)
These areas are under jurisdiction of state governments, not the U.S. Federal Government

[**NOAA Statistical Areas**](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/map/greater-atlantic-region-statistical-areas)
NOAA Statistical Areas were downloaded from the Northeast Fisheries Science Center FTP server (linked at the bottom of the page linked above) and trimmed to only the NOAA statistical areas administered by GARFO. 

[**Dedicated Habitat Research Areas**](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/map/dedicated-habitat-research-areas-map-gis)
Footprints of the Stellwagen Bank and Georges Bank DHRAs. 

- Stellwagen Bank DHRA is closed to all commercial mobile bottom-tending gear, commercial sink gillnet gear, and commercial demersal longline gear. 

- Georges Bank DHRA is closed to all mobile bottom-tending gear. 

[**Frank R. Lautenberg Deep Sea Coral Protection Areas**](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/map/frank-r-lautenberg-deep-sea-coral-protection-areas-map-gis)
The Frank R. Lautenberg Deep Sea Coral Protection Areas are closed to all bottom tending commercial fishing gear, defined as bottom-tending otter trawls, bottom-tending beam trawls, hydraulic dredges, non-hydraulic dredges, bottom-tending seines, bottom-tending longlines, sink or anchored gill nets, and pots and traps except those use to fish fro red crab and American lobster. 

[**Groundfish Closure Areas**](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/map/northeast-groundfish-closure-areas)
This shapefile includes three closures as follows:

- Cashes Ledge Closure is closed year-round to all fishing vessels, with the following exemptions: Charter and party* or recreational vessels; vessels fishing with exempted gears (spears, rakes, diving gear, cast nets, tongs, harpoons, weirs, dip nets, stop nets, pound nets, pots and traps, purse seines, surf clam/ quahog dredge gear, pelagic hook and line, pelagic longlines, single pelagic gillnets, and shrimp trawls (with properly configured grates)); and vessels participating in the mid-water trawl exempted fishery.

- Closed Area II Closure is closed year-round to all fishing vessels, with the following exceptions:  Vessels fishing with or using pot gear designed to take lobsters or hagfish, pelagic hook and line gear, pelagic longline gear, harpoon gear, tuna purse seine, pelagic mid-water trawl gear*, and tuna purse seine gear, provided no regulated species are kept and no other gear capable of catching NE multispecies is on board; and vessels fishing in a groundfish special access program (SAP) or scallop access program in compliance with the regulations.

- Western Gulf of Maine Closure is closed year-round to all fishing vessels, with the following exemptions: Charter and party* or recreational vessels; vessels fishing with exempted gears (spears, rakes, diving gear, cast nets, tongs, harpoons, weirs, dip nets, stop nets, pound nets, pots and traps, purse seines, surf clam/ quahog dredge gear, pelagic hook and line, pelagic longlines, single pelagic gillnets, and shrimp trawls (with properly configured grates)); and vessels participating in the mid-water trawl exempted fishery.

[**Habitat Management Areas**](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/map/habitat-management-areas-map-gis)
This shapefile contains 10 HMAs. Unless otherwise noted, no fishing vessel may fish with bottom-tending mobile gear in the areas defined in the shapefile. Notes below:

- Ammen Rock HMA is closed to all fishing vessels including private and fore hire recreational vessels except for vessels fishing exclusively with lobster traps. 

- Western Gulf of Maine Shrimp Exemption Area: Vessels fishing with shrimp trawls under the Small Mesh Northern Shrimp Fishery Exemption specified at ยง 648.80(a)(5) may fish within the Western Gulf of Maine HMA Shrimp Exemption Area
